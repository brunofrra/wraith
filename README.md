## Etymology

From <https://www.etymonline.com/word/fetch> (*emphasis mine*):

> fetch (n.1)
>
> "apparition of a living person, specter, a double," 1787, an English dialect
> word of unknown origin (see OED for discussion).
>
> > A peculiarly weird type of apparition is the *wraith* (q.v.) or double, of
> > which the Irish *fetch* is a variant. The *wraith* is an exact facsimile of
> > a living person, who may himself see it. Goethe, Shelley, and other famous
> > men are said to have seen their own *wraiths*. The *fetch* makes its
> > appearance shortly before the death of the person it represents, either to
> > himself or his friends, or both. [Lewis Spence, "An Encyclopedia of
> > Occultism," 1920]
